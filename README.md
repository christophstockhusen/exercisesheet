# The exercisesheet Class #

The aim of this LaTeX class is to provide a set of useful macros for
typesetting high-quality exercise sheets for both students and
teachers. This is the official manual. It contains tutorials on how to
use this class and, moreover, a comprehensive list of the available
commands. Files with the complete code of the templates are available
with this package; You can download them from 
> https://github.com/christophstockhusen/exercisesheet
Currently, this class is a victim to heavy development action which
may result in several conceptual changes in the future. Please be
patient and help me creating an even more useful \LaTeX{} class by
submitting bugs, issues, and comments on the website above. Thank you!
I hope you enjoy using this class.
